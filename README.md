It uses the M5StickC from M5Stack as motion sensor and a TV or any PC with a browser as display. The M5StickC connects with your local WiFi, displays it's IP address and hosts a website. After browse with your TV or any browser to the displayed IP address you should see something like pictured in the above screenshot. When you shake the M5StickC it randomly determines the name of the next one to open a present and displays it on it's display and after a short moment on the website. You can enter your own names in the source code before flashing the M5StickC.
